- 👋 Hi, I’m Giselle, but you can also call me Gisa
- 👀 I’m interested in games, reading, movies, arts, drawing, and every creative thing, I also have some experience with solidworks
- 🌱 I’m on a journey of learning programming as a student of computer engineering. I also decided to learn by myself how to use blender and ZBrush.
- 💞️ I’m a Software Engineer
- 📫 How to reach me: you can find me on linkedin, or looking at other social medias
- Curiosity: To finish high school, I made a project with my group of creating a game that was about problems faced by social minorities, focusing on the LGBTQIAP+ comunity, through the RPG Maker MV. I hope
that in the future I can work more with game developing, at coding, writing or even the design. If you want to check a bit of how the game worked, here is the link of the trailer - https://youtu.be/8JIFDkL52Nc
- It's a pleasure to meet you, thank you for taking a look at my profile :)
